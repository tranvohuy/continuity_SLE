# continuity_SLE
-see how Loewner curves change w.r.t parameters

-Use the zipper method to approximate the solution.

There are two other methods: Newton + reverse flow, Newton + forward flow + scanning all points in the upper halfplane.
Each has its own advantages and disadvantages.

-Compute SLE for different kappa. Then visualize the results.

-Compute the tip for different kappa. See if it changes continuously.
